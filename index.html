      <h1> Ezra Ohtli</h1>
       <div id="quote"><p><strong>“They buried me in their home. They huddled around a fire in the house, not daring to leave for fear that a neighbor would steal their fire or eat their dead babe. They were sipping on hot water to manage the hunger when they heard me cry. They dug through the earth with shovel and hands until they could pull me out of the ground like a carrot, and they held me. They stared at me as I stared at the warm fire.”
      </strong></p><br></div>
        <p>Ezra Ohtli is a wanderer at heart. His parents lived in squalor, and the village exiled him shortly after. He's never been welcomed in any place for too long; between his pale, cold skin, and his magical abilities, he's unnerving company. He’s learned to survive off very little, and sells his expertise as a guide. He grew into his magical abilities naturally and without incident, wading into the supernatural as if it were a warm, shallow pool. It’s a part of his life, and it’s unnerving to think that others live without it. As he grew in power and experience, He leveraged himself into more adventurous positions and trades in order to fulfill his wanderlust and feed his thrill seeking. There is a part of him that is empty and, while it is the source of his power, he seeks to fill it with excitement and that sense of kinship that seems to come so easily to others. He’s recently founded a mercenary group, the “Good Children”, as a way to seek and fund adventure, as well as to journey to Oshenshale. His half-elf parents told Ezra stories of the ancient city, and these stories give Ezra hope that the hole in his heart can be filled.
</p>
      <p>Ezra doesn’t worship any gods; He hasn’t personally met any of them yet, and unimpressed with their current work. He does, however, have respect for two gods in particular. He listens fondly to stories about Dax because those stories have the emotion and motion that Ezra seeks in his own life. He both fears and craves a meeting with Eshe, the embodiment of the void, because it’s the closest thing Ezra might have to a home.
